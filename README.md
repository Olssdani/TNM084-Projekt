# TNM084-Projekt
This is a miniproject in the course TNM084 - Procedural methods for images where I have created a low poly procedural world with procedural generated ferns and trees with a L-system. The goal was to have the trees and ferns to automatical align with the ground by doing a depth analysis of the map but that contains some bugs for the moment 

## Future work
This project will not be continued worked with since it was created during a very short deadline and therefor is the base of the code not good and would need to be rewritten

The placement of the trees are random however there is a treshold value that is compared against a perlin noise to make the placement of the trees be more like a forrest where there is trees in certain areas and no trees in others.
